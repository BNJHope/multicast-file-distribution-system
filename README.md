# Multicast File Distribution System
Multicast file distribution system implemented in Python 3. File blocks are transferred over UDP and then control messages
to determine which packets were missed in transfer etc. are transmitted over TCP.

Only tested on internal network at the University of St Andrews Department of Computer Science - the system implementation is described in the report file.
